This is where I will type about which editor I prefer and why...

After getting through all the tutorials I have to say that I like Nano the best. Yest it was a little tricky to learn how to open files but once I got the hang of it, it was smooth sailing. 


Notes so far, I really liked nano once I got used to the way I needed to ask the progam to open files, it was a little cumbersome at first, and in all fairness stayed fairly cumbersome throughout but by the end of the assingment we went from mortal enemies tto something akin to "frenemies:"

Emacs: I DO NOT like the command list, it seeems quite counter intuitive, especially when you have to open, save, and close files there are so many keys to hit and it is really easy to "fat-finger" a key or forget to hit it altogether. I also am not a fan of using both "Control" key and "Meta" key...and having key combos that sometime require you to hold C or M and then hit the next jey or sometime require a tap of c or m (notice cases) was infuriating. 

After using Vim, I understand why it's used so much. It is a very powerful tool, I thought that it was interesting that it allowed for a user to "scroll" through multiple documents and even edit several documents at the same time. I did not like the commands though, and the modes was confusing and took time to understand.
